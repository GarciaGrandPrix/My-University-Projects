For the Text Based Game, the player must collect items from various locations to defeat the game's boss. The Player inputs the Collection of Items in-game, which are stored within a List. Locations where the player visits are recorded, including when a player
collects an item. If the player has less than the required number of items, they lose. If they have as much needed, they win. 

For the Java Classes, they are a part of the Service Animal Reservation Project. This project centered on creating a program that allowed individuals to reserve a service animal by choosing between a dog or monkey, and have the
program check the availability of the animal you wanted based on location and other criteria such as size and weight of the animal. Getters and setters were used to record the inputs of the user, this allowed the use of code between different classes instead of putting all the code into
one single page.
