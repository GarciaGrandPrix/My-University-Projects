For the Text Based Game, the player must collect items from various locations to defeat the game's boss. The Player inputs the Collection of Items in-game, which are stored within a List. Locations where the player visits are recorded, including when a player
collects an item. If the player has less than the required number of items, they lose. If they have as much needed, they win. 

For the Java Classes, they are a part of the Service Animal Reservation Project. This project centered on creating a program that allowed individuals to reserve a service animal by choosing between a dog or monkey, and have the
program check the availability of the animal you wanted based on location and other criteria such as size and weight of the animal. Getters and setters were used to record the inputs of the user, this allowed the use of code between different classes instead of putting all the code into
one single page.

There are also three separate projects I've made in Cisco Packet Tracer. One project "Static Routing 4 Routers Connected", contains a network I created. This network is using static routing to connect all workstations with each other to their respective routers, Network addresses are explicitly written within the routers so all workstations can communicate with each other. 

The second project "Dynamic Routing" invokves using dynamic routing to achieve the same results without using static routing, allowing for easier management of network addresses within a router on a network.

The third project "CYB 310 Network Defense Project Three Joshua Garcia" is a network designed with web-application-based firewalls in mind. The work I handed in for this project was done on a virtual machine that I could not save my work. However, this project on Cisco Packet Tracer I made is a demonstration of that network, which was made before the work was done on the virtual machine to test the overal connectivity of the network based off of the project specifications of what the network should look like and its configurations.
